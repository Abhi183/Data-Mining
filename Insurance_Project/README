DATASET:(https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv)
Total records: 1338
Attributes: age,sex,bmi,children, smoker, region, charges
Since “charges” is continuous, we classified into 4 classes (“Tier 0”,“Tier 1”,“Tier 2”,“Tier 3”)
Update attributes region (“southwest”: 1 and “northwest”: 0) and sex (“male”: 1 and “female”: 0)

TECHNIQUES USED:
Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Classifier(NBC), Support Vector Machine(SVM),
Artificial Neural Network(ANN), K-mean Clustering

DATA CLASSIFICATION:
_ For training: 80% of the data use for training model
_ For testing: 20% of the data use for testing
